# C++ and Data Structures (CDS) Lab ‚Äì Semester III

Welcome to the official repository for the *CDS Lab* conducted as part of the undergraduate curriculum. This repository contains C++ programs for the first five experiments performed in the lab, along with basic theoretical explanations.

## üìö Overview

This lab focuses on introducing the core concepts of C++ programming and its applications in building a strong foundation for data structures. The experiments are aimed at hands-on learning of syntax, operators, control structures, and bit-level operations.

## üß™ Experiments

### ‚úÖ Expt 1: Hello World and Calculator Program

*Objective*:  
To understand the basic syntax of a C++ program and create a simple calculator.

*Theory*:
- Learn the structure of a C++ program (headers, main() function, etc.).
- Use basic I/O using cin and cout.
- Implement arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).

### ‚úÖ Expt 2: C++ Program Structure (Data Types)

*Objective*:  
To study various data types and variables used in C++.

*Theory*:
- Learn about fundamental data types: int, float, double, char, bool.
- Understand the concept of constants, type modifiers (long, short, signed, unsigned).
- Explore variable declaration, initialization, and type casting.

### ‚úÖ Expt 3: Operators in C++

*Objective*:  
To explore and implement various types of operators.

*Theory*:
- *Arithmetic Operators*: +, -, *, /, %
- *Relational Operators*: ==, !=, <, >, <=, >=
- *Logical Operators*: &&, ||, !
- *Assignment Operators*: =, +=, -=, etc.
- Operator precedence and associativity.

### ‚úÖ Expt 4: Bitwise Operators

*Objective*:  
To study and implement bitwise operators in C++.

*Theory*:
- *Bitwise AND* (&), *OR* (|), *XOR* (^), *NOT* (~)
- *Left Shift* (<<) and *Right Shift* (>>)
- Applications: low-level programming, optimization, masking, flags.

### ‚úÖ Expt 5: Decision Making Statements

*Objective*:  
To implement control structures in C++.

*Theory*:
- *if, **if-else, **nested if, and **else-if ladder*
- *switch-case* control flow
- Importance of conditional execution in programming logic

### ‚úÖ Expt 6: Loops(for and While)

*Objective*:  
To implement decision making statements Loops in C++.

*Theory*:
Loop Constructs
for loops handle repetitive tasks like printing numbers or strings.

continue inside a loop skips the current iteration and proceeds with the next, useful for skipping certain values (e.g., 3 and 5)

3. Password Authentication Logic
This is a simple ‚Äúsomething you know‚Äù scenario: the user sets a password, then must correctly re-enter it within 3 attempts

If the guess matches, access is granted immediately; otherwise, the user gets feedback and another chance.

Once attempts run out, the program denies access and ends.
