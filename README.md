# C++ and Data Structures (CDS) Lab â€“ Semester III

Welcome to the official repository for the *CDS Lab* conducted as part of the undergraduate curriculum. This repository contains C++ programs for the first five experiments performed in the lab, along with basic theoretical explanations.

## ðŸ“š Overview

This lab focuses on introducing the core concepts of C++ programming and its applications in building a strong foundation for data structures. The experiments are aimed at hands-on learning of syntax, operators, control structures, and bit-level operations.

## ðŸ§ª Experiments

### âœ… Expt 1: Hello World and Calculator Program

*Objective*:  
To understand the basic syntax of a C++ program and create a simple calculator.

*Theory*:
- Learn the structure of a C++ program (headers, main() function, etc.).
- Use basic I/O using cin and cout.
- Implement arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).

### âœ… Expt 2: C++ Program Structure (Data Types)

*Objective*:  
To study various data types and variables used in C++.

*Theory*:
- Learn about fundamental data types: int, float, double, char, bool.
- Understand the concept of constants, type modifiers (long, short, signed, unsigned).
- Explore variable declaration, initialization, and type casting.

### âœ… Expt 3: Operators in C++

*Objective*:  
To explore and implement various types of operators.

*Theory*:
- *Arithmetic Operators*: +, -, *, /, %
- *Relational Operators*: ==, !=, <, >, <=, >=
- *Logical Operators*: &&, ||, !
- *Assignment Operators*: =, +=, -=, etc.
- Operator precedence and associativity.

### âœ… Expt 4: Bitwise Operators

*Objective*:  
To study and implement bitwise operators in C++.

*Theory*:
- *Bitwise AND* (&), *OR* (|), *XOR* (^), *NOT* (~)
- *Left Shift* (<<) and *Right Shift* (>>)
- Applications: low-level programming, optimization, masking, flags.

### âœ… Expt 5: Decision Making Statements

*Objective*:  
To implement control structures in C++.

*Theory*:
- *if, **if-else, **nested if, and **else-if ladder*
- *switch-case* control flow
- Importance of conditional execution in programming logic
