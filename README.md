# C++ and Data Structures (CDS) Lab ‚Äì Semester III

Welcome to the official repository for the *CDS Lab* conducted as part of the undergraduate curriculum. This repository contains C++ programs for the first five experiments performed in the lab, along with basic theoretical explanations.

## üìö Overview

This lab focuses on introducing the core concepts of C++ programming and its applications in building a strong foundation for data structures. The experiments are aimed at hands-on learning of syntax, operators, control structures, and bit-level operations.

## üß™ Experiments

### ‚úÖ Expt 1: Hello World and Calculator Program

*Objective*:  
To understand the basic syntax of a C++ program and create a simple calculator.

*Theory*:
- Learn the structure of a C++ program (headers, main() function, etc.).
- Use basic I/O using cin and cout.
- Implement arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).

 *Algorithm*: 
 Start

Include necessary header files (e.g., #include <iostream>)

Define main() function.

Print "Hello World" message.

Declare variables to store two numbers and the result.

Prompt user to enter two numbers.

Read the input numbers.

Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Display the results of all operations.

End.

### ‚úÖ Expt 2: C++ Program Structure (Data Types)

*Objective*:  
To study various data types and variables used in C++.

*Theory*:
- Learn about fundamental data types: int, float, double, char, bool.
- Understand the concept of constants, type modifiers (long, short, signed, unsigned).
- Explore variable declaration, initialization, and type casting.

*Algorithm*: 
Start

Include necessary headers.

Define main() function.

Declare variables of different data types (int, float, double, char, bool).

Initialize variables with sample values.

Display values and demonstrate type casting (e.g., from float to int).

Use constants and demonstrate type modifiers (long, short, signed, unsigned).

End.

### ‚úÖ Expt 3: Operators in C++

*Objective*:  
To explore and implement various types of operators.

*Theory*:
- *Arithmetic Operators*: +, -, *, /, %
- *Relational Operators*: ==, !=, <, >, <=, >=
- *Logical Operators*: &&, ||, !
- *Assignment Operators*: =, +=, -=, etc.
- Operator precedence and associativity.

  *Algorithm*:
  Start

Include headers and define main().

Declare variables for operands.

Demonstrate arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /, %) and output results.

Demonstrate relational operators (==, !=, <, >, <=, >=) and output results.

Demonstrate logical operators (&&, ||, !) and output results.

Demonstrate assignment operators (=, +=, -=) and output results.

Explain operator precedence and associativity with examples.

End.

### ‚úÖ Expt 4: Bitwise Operators

*Objective*:  
To study and implement bitwise operators in C++.

*Theory*:
- *Bitwise AND* (&), *OR* (|), *XOR* (^), *NOT* (~)
- *Left Shift* (<<) and *Right Shift* (>>)
- Applications: low-level programming, optimization, masking, flags.

*Algorithm*:
Start

Include headers and define main().

Declare integer variables.

Demonstrate bitwise operations: AND (&), OR (|), XOR (^), NOT (~).

Demonstrate left shift (<<) and right shift (>>).

Show example applications: masking bits, flags.

End.

### ‚úÖ Expt 5: Decision Making Statements

*Objective*:  
To implement control structures in C++.

*Theory*:
- *if, **if-else, **nested if, and **else-if ladder*
- *switch-case* control flow
- Importance of conditional execution in programming logic

*Algorithm*:

Start

Include headers and define main().

Demonstrate if statement.

Demonstrate if-else statement.

Demonstrate nested if.

Demonstrate else-if ladder.

Demonstrate switch-case statement with multiple cases.

Explain importance of conditional execution.

End.

### ‚úÖ Expt 6: Loops(for and While)

*Objective*:  
To implement decision making statements Loops in C++.

*Theory*:
Loop Constructs
for loops handle repetitive tasks like printing numbers or strings.

continue inside a loop skips the current iteration and proceeds with the next, useful for skipping certain values (e.g., 3 and 5)

3. Password Authentication Logic
This is a simple ‚Äúsomething you know‚Äù scenario: the user sets a password, then must correctly re-enter it within 3 attempts

.

If the guess matches, access is granted immediately; otherwise, the user gets feedback and another chance.

Once attempts run out, the program denies access and ends.

*Algorithm*:
Start

Include headers and define main().

Demonstrate for loop to print a sequence of numbers or stars.

Demonstrate while loop for similar tasks.

Explain continue statement and show example skipping values (like skipping 3 and 5).

Implement password authentication logic:

Prompt user to set password.

Allow up to 3 attempts to enter the correct password.

If correct, grant access and exit.

If attempts exhausted, deny access.

End.
